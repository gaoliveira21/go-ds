# go-ds

A collection of data structures implemented in Go.

## Project Structure
- `array/` - Dynamic array implementation and tests
- `doubly_linked_list/` - Doubly linked list and node implementations with tests
- `queue/` - Queue implementation and tests
- `singly_linked_list/` - Singly linked list and node implementations with tests

## Getting Started
Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/gaoliveira21/go-ds.git
cd go-ds
```

## Running Tests
To run all tests:
```sh
go test ./...
```
Or run tests for a specific data structure:
```sh
go test ./array
```

## Data Structures

### Dynamic Array
Resizable array supporting basic operations.

### Singly Linked List
Standard singly linked list with node structure.

### Doubly Linked List
Doubly linked list with forward and backward traversal.

### Queue
FIFO queue implementation.
